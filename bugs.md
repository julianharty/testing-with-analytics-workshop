# Bugs
One of the aims of the testing with analytics workshop is to find software bugs. The Pocket Code project team uses JIRA to report, track and manage bugs for the project. These are publicly visible at https://jira.catrob.at/ As part of the workshop you're welcome to report bugs on the project's JIRA site. To do you you will need an account, which you can create directly. If that doesn't work for you please ask for help during the workshop.

Please add a label to your bug reports, for the workshop the label to use is `testfest2020`
