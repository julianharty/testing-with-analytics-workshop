# Virtual Devices
If you want to use a virtual device, the relevant software is freely available for Android, albeit sometimes fairly involved to actually create.

Here are some articles online for creating Android virtual devices. Of these, the most reliable is to install the Android Studio software, however that's a large install and only a small subset is actually needed. We have tested creating and using the Android Virtual Devices provided by Google.

* Amiduos (however this was discontinued in 2018, see archived blog post and apprently many of the downloads may have a virus)
* Using Gennymotion (2018) for personal research purposes https://www.bellingcat.com/resources/how-tos/2018/08/23/creating-android-open-source-research-device-pc/
* Using the Android AVD devices https://developer.android.com/studio/run/emulator. https://rishikc.com/articles/native-app-emulator-android-mac-linux-ios-install-command-line/ seems to provide fairly comprehensive instructions. And here are tons of answers for those who want to use the command line once they've worked out how to install the relevant tools from Android https://stackoverflow.com/questions/42718973/run-avd-emulator-without-android-studio
