If you have a real phone you are willing to use, that's great. Otherwise you can have a go at using one of the various online device test farms or a virtual device. There are various tutorials and guides available. Here are some to get you started for [virtual devices](virtual-devices.md), we have not tested these unless we say so on this site.
